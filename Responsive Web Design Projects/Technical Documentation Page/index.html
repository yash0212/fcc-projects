                Variable is a named memory location used to hold a value that can be changed during the script
                execution. Following are the basic rules for naming a variable.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You must use a letter as the first character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can't use a space, period (.), exclamation mark (!), or the characters @, &, $, # in the name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Name can't exceed 255 characters in length.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You cannot use Visual Basic reserved keywords as variable name.

                An Operator can be defined using a simple expression - 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called
                operands and + is called operator. VBA supports following types of operators âˆ’

                Decision making allows the programmers to control the execution flow of a script or one of its
                sections. The execution is governed by one or more conditional statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming
                languages.

                There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general,
                statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by
                the second, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution
                paths.

            <p>
                A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Following is
                the general form of a loop statement in VBA.

                Strings are a sequence of characters, which can consist of either alphabets, numbers, special
                characters, or all of them. A variable is said to be a string if it is enclosed within double quotes "
                ".

                VBScript Date and Time Functions help the developers to convert date and time from one format to
                another or to express the date or time value in the format that suits a specific condition.

            <p>
                We know very well that a variable is a container to store a value. Sometimes, developers are in a
                position to hold more than one value in a single variable at a time. When a series of values are stored
                in a single variable, then it is known as an array
                variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Array Declaration</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Arrays are declared the same way a variable has been declared except that the declaration of an array
                variable uses parenthesis. In the following example, the size of the array is mentioned in the
                brackets.
            </p>
            <code>
  <xmp>
'Method 1 : Using Dim
Dim arr1()	'Without Size

'Method 2 : Mentioning the Size
Dim arr2(5)  'Declared with size of 5

'Method 3 : using 'Array' Parameter
Dim arr3
arr3 = Array("apple","Orange","Grapes")
  </xmp>
      </code>
            <ul>
                <li>Although, the array size is indicated as 5, it can hold 6 values as array index starts from ZERO.</li>

                <li>Array Index cannot be negative.</li>

                <li>VBScript Arrays can store any type of variable in an array. Hence, an array can store an integer,
                    string, or characters in a single array variable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Assigning Values to an Array</h2>
            <p>
                The values are assigned to the array by specifying an array index value against each one of the values
                to be assigned. It can be a string.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example</strong>
                <br>Add a button and add the following function.</p>
            <code>
  <xmp>
Private Sub Constant_demo_Click()
   Dim arr(5)
   arr(0) = "1"           'Number as String
   arr(1) = "VBScript"    'String
   arr(2) = 100 		   'Number
   arr(3) = 2.45 		   'Decimal Number
   arr(4) = #10/07/2013#  'Date
   arr(5) = #12.45 PM#    'Time
  
   msgbox("Value stored in Array index 0 : " & arr(0))
   msgbox("Value stored in Array index 1 : " & arr(1))
   msgbox("Value stored in Array index 2 : " & arr(2))
   msgbox("Value stored in Array index 3 : " & arr(3))
   msgbox("Value stored in Array index 4 : " & arr(4))
   msgbox("Value stored in Array index 5 : " & arr(5))
End Sub
  </xmp>
  </code>
            <p>When you execute the above function, it produces the following output.</p>
            <code>
  <xmp>
Value stored in Array index 0 : 1
Value stored in Array index 1 : VBScript
Value stored in Array index 2 : 100
Value stored in Array index 3 : 2.45
Value stored in Array index 4 : 7/10/2013
Value stored in Array index 5 : 12:45:00 PM
