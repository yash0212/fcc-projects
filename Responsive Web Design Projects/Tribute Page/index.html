        <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October 1931 â€“
        27 July 2015) was an Indian politician and aerospace scientist who
        served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
        raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
        administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
        was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
        missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man
        of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
        vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
        first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

        Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the
        support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
        "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education,
        writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
        several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
        civilian honour.

        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
        Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27
        July 2015, aged 83. Thousands including national-level dignitaries
        attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where
        he was buried with full state honours.
